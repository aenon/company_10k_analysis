ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Trends in Our BusinessThe following trends have contributed to the results of our operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results:•User behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves. The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since our inception, resulting in increasing revenues, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business. •Users are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formats.Our users are accessing the Internet via multiple devices. Mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing.  We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business.In this multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. Our traffic acquisition cost (TAC) may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may not be as favorable to us as those with our traditional desktop and tablet formats.  We expect both of these trends to continue to pressure our overall margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.•As users in developing economies increasingly come online, we generate more and more revenues from international markets.The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., especially in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets.  This has led to increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available.Our international revenues have gone from 55% of total revenues in 2013 to 57% in 2014. As a result, we are increasingly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.•As we seek to provide our users with products and services in a multi-screen environment, the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing.  Non-advertising revenues have gone from 9% of total revenues in 2013 to 11% in 2014. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products like Google Play, Google for Work, and Nexus devices.  We derive other revenues primarily from sales of digital content products, hardware sales, and licensing.  The margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business.•As we continue to look for new ways to serve our users, we will invest heavily in R&D and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate.We continue to make significant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus, such as search and advertising, as well as in new products and services. The amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure.In addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.21Table of Contents•Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. Their energy and talent drive Google and create our success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had 53,600 full-time employees: 20,832 in research and development, 17,621 in sales and marketing, 7,510 in general and administrative, and 7,637 in operations, an increase of 9,738 total headcount from December 31, 2013.Executive Overview of ResultsHere are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014:•Consolidated revenues increased 18.9% to $66.0 billion, primarily driven by an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and an increase in other revenues, and to a lesser extent, an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google Network Members' websites.•Revenues from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Rest of World were, $28.1 billion, $6.5 billion, and $31.4 billion, respectively.•Cost of revenues was $25.7 billion, consisting of traffic acquisition costs of $13.5 billion and other cost of revenues of $12.2 billion. Our traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was 22.9%. •Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $23.8 billion, primarily driven by labor and facilities-related costs for our research and development and sales and marketing functions, advertising and promotional expenses, and stock-based compensation expense.•Income from operations was $16.5 billion.•Effective tax rate was 19.3%.•Net income was $14.4 billion with diluted earnings per share of $21.02.•Operating cash flow was $22.4 billion.•Capital expenditures were $11.0 billion.Results of OperationsThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented: Year Ended December 31,2012 2013 2014Consolidated Statements of Income Data:     Revenues100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0%Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues37.3 39.6 38.9Research and development13.2 12.9 14.9Sales and marketing11.9 11.8 12.3General and administrative7.6 8.0 8.9Total costs and expenses70.0 % 72.3 % 75.0%Income from operations30.0 27.7 25.0Interest and other income, net1.4 0.9 1.2Income from continuing operations before income taxes 31.4 28.6 26.2Provision for income taxes6.3 4.6 5.1Net income from continuing operations25.1 24.0 21.1Net income (loss) from discontinued operations(1.8) (0.7) 0.8Net income23.3 % 23.3 % 21.9%MotorolaOn May 22, 2012, we acquired Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc.

Our advertising revenues growth was driven primarily by an increase in the number of aggregate paid clicks through our advertising programs of 20% from 2013 to 2014. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, and an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. The positive impact of our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers of 5% from 2013 to 2014. The decrease was due to various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.Our advertising revenues increased $6,861 million from 2012 to 2013. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites, and to a lesser extent, an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google Network Members' websites. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members' websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, as paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites increased approximately 25% from 2012 to 2013. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. This revenue 23Table of Contentsincrease was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites decreased approximately 8% from 2012 to 2013. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was driven by various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.Our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, advertising trends, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, and our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers.The following table presents the changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click for the periods presented (in percentage terms): Change from 2012 to 2013 Change from 2013 to 2014Aggregate paid clicks25 % 20 %Paid clicks on Google websites (1)33 % 29 %Paid clicks on Google Network Members' websites (2)11 % 2 %    Aggregate cost-per-click(8)% (5)%Cost-per-click on Google websites(10)% (7)%Cost-per-click on Google Network Members' websites(8)% (6)%    (1) Paid clicks on Google websites include clicks related to ads served on Google owned and operated properties across different geographies and devices, including search, YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, and other owned and operated properties including Maps and Finance.(2) Paid clicks on Google Network Members' websites include clicks related to ads served on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob businesses.The rate of change in revenues, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:•growth rates of our revenues from Google websites compared to those of our revenues from Google Network Members' websites;•advertiser competition for keywords;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•seasonality;•the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;•changes in advertising quality or formats;•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels; •a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in Google websites and Google Network Members' websites; and•general economic conditions.Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites may not reflect our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.Other Revenues Other revenues increased $1,973 million from 2013 to 2014 and also increased as a percentage of total revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our sales of digital content products, such as apps, music, and movies on the Google Play store.Other revenues increased $2,619 million from 2012 to 2013 and also increased as a percentage of revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our digital content products, such as apps, music, and movies.  We also 24Table of Contentsexperienced an increase in our hardware revenues due to increased sales of Chromecast, directly-sold Nexus products, and Chrome OS devices.Revenues by GeographyThe following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014United States46% 45% 43%United Kingdom11% 10% 10%Rest of the world43% 45% 47%The growth in revenues from rest of the world as a percentage of revenues from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for international markets, partially offset in 2014 by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenuesOur international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. For the purposes of determining the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our revenues, we take the U.S. dollar equivalent of foreign currency-denominated revenues of a particular period translated at the current period exchange rates minus the same revenues translated at corresponding prior year rates.We use foreign currency options to hedge certain foreign exchange impacts on our forecasted earnings. To the extent these derivatives are effective in managing our foreign exchange risk, we will reflect the hedge benefit in revenues in the period the hedged revenues are recorded. We pay a premium reflecting the time value of the option on the date of purchase. The changes in the time value of the option are reflected in interest and other income, net, over the life of the option, in the period incurred.The following table presents our foreign exchange impact on revenues for the periods presented: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014United Kingdom revenues$4,846 $5,600 $6,483Foreign exchange impact on current year revenues using corresponding prior year exchange rates -- (revenues would be higher)/revenues would be lower(68) (67) 303Hedging gains recognized in current year18 63 3      Rest of the world revenues$19,906 $25,167 $31,379Foreign exchange impact on current year revenues using corresponding prior year exchange rates -- (revenues would be higher)/revenues would be lower(1,099) (536) (858)Hedging gains recognized in current year199 32 168In 2014, our revenues from the United Kingdom were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to certain currencies, most notably the British pound. Our revenues from the rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, and partially offset by the favorable impact of the U.S. dollar weakening against certain currencies, most notably the euro.In 2013, our revenues from the United Kingdom were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the British pound. Our revenues from the rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real, and partially offset by the favorable impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to certain currencies, including the euro.25Table of ContentsCosts and ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues minus traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:•Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);•The expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs); •Inventory costs for hardware we sell; •Stock-based compensation paid to our employees;•Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; and •Amortization of certain intangible assets. The following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Traffic acquisition costs$10,956 $12,258 $13,497Other cost of revenues$6,220 $9,735 $12,194Total cost of revenues$17,176 $21,993 $25,691Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues37.3% 39.6% 38.9% Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members$8,791 $9,293 $9,864Traffic acquisition costs to distribution partners2,165 2,965 3,633Traffic acquisition costs$10,956 $12,258 $13,497Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues25.1% 24.2% 22.9%The cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our AdSense program on the websites of our Google Network Members, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content, are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from Google websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period. Cost of revenues increased $3,698 million from 2013 to 2014. The increase was partially due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,239 million resulting from more distribution fees paid for additional traffic directed to Google websites, as well as more advertiser fees paid to Google Network Members, driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. The remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased usage activities related to YouTube and digital content by our users, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  In addition, the increase was also driven by an impairment charge related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between Google website revenue and Google Network Members' websites revenue.Cost of revenues increased $4,817 million from 2012 to 2013. The increase was due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,302 million resulting from more distribution fees paid, more fees paid for additional traffic directed to Google websites, as well as more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The remaining increase 26Table of Contentswas primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, hardware inventory costs as a result of increased hardware sales, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube and digital content, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily as a result of a shift of mix between Google website revenue and Google Network Members' websites revenue.We expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2015 and future periods, based on a number of factors, including the following:•The relative growth rates of revenues from Google websites and from our Google Network Members’ websites;•The growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, as well as our hardware inventory costs;•Increased proportion of other non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues;•Whether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with Google Network Members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements;•Whether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on Google websites and our Google Network Members' websites; and•The relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated.Research and DevelopmentThe following table presents our R&D expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Research and development expenses$6,083 $7,137 $9,832Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues13.2% 12.9% 14.9%R&D expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D in our existing businesses as well as new products and services;•Depreciation and equipment-related expenses; and•Stock-based compensation expense for employees responsible for R&D.R&D expenses increased $2,695 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,289 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $559 million, both largely as a result of a 27% increase in R&D headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $425 million and an increase in professional services of $371 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services. R&D expenses increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to a higher increase in labor and facilities-related costs relative to the increase in revenues.R&D expenses increased $1,054 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $596 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $367 million, both largely as a result of an 18% increase in R&D headcount.We expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and future periods.27Table of ContentsSales and MarketingThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Sales and marketing expenses$5,465 $6,554 $8,131Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues11.9% 11.8% 12.3%Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for our personnel engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions;•Advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and•Stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, and certain customer service functions.Sales and marketing expenses increased $1,577 million and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $614 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $571 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $163 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in sales and marketing headcount. Sales and marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses relative to the increase in revenues.Sales and marketing expenses increased $1,089 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $674 million, as well as an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $233 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $103 million, both largely resulting from a 13% increase in sales and marketing headcount.We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and future periods.General and AdministrativeThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014General and administrative expenses$3,481 $4,432 $5,851General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues7.6% 8.0% 8.9%General and administrative expenses consist primarily of:•Labor and facilities-related costs for personnel in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;•Professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services;•Amortization of certain intangible assets; and•Stock-based compensation expense.General and administrative expenses increased $1,419 million and also increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $576 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $260 million, both largely resulting from a 24% increase in general and administrative headcount. In addition, there was an increase in professional services related expense of $314 million due to higher legal-related costs, as well as additional consulting and outsourced services. General and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs and stock-based compensation expense relative to the increase in revenues.General and administrative expenses increased $951 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and 28Table of Contentsfacilities-related costs of $396 million, largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount, an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expense of $222 million, as well as an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million.We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and in future periods. Stock-Based CompensationThe following table presents our aggregate stock-based compensation expense, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues, as reflected in our consolidated results from continuing operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Stock-based compensation$2,473 $3,127 $4,175Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues5.4% 5.6% 6.3%Stock-based compensation increased $1,048 million from 2013 to 2014 and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues. These increases were primarily due to an increased headcount to support our growing business. In addition, we granted additional stock awards to our employees throughout 2014.Stock-based compensation increased $654 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of consolidated revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. This increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growing business.  We estimate stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $4.3 billion in 2015 and $5.5 billion thereafter related to stock awards outstanding as of December 31, 2014. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2014. If forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.Interest and Other Income, NetThe following table presents the components included in Interest and Other Income, Net, as reflected in our consolidated results from continuing operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Interest and other income, net$635 $496 $763Interest and other income, net as a percentage of revenues1.4% 0.9% 1.2%Interest and other income, net, increased $267 million from 2013 to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by realized gains on non-marketable equity investments of $159 million and previously-held equity interests of $126 million, as well as a loss recognized on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) in 2013.  These increases were partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of $23 million and a decrease in interest income of $20 million.Interest and other income, net, decreased $139 million from 2012 to 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the gain on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) of $245 million and a decrease in the realized gain on investments of $124 million, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange loss of $135 million and an increase in interest income of $66 million.The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized to interest and other income, net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.As we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in 2015 and future periods.29Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Provision for income taxes$2,916 $2,552 $3,331Effective tax rate20.2% 16.1% 19.3%Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2013 to 2014, largely due to proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have higher statutory tax rates and more benefit recognized in 2013 relative to 2014 due to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit, offset by a benefit taken on a valuation allowance release related to a capital loss carryforward in 2014.Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from 2012 to 2013, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, as well as the federal research and development credit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which was applied in the first quarter of 2013.A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. Further information on these issues, the treatment of undistributed foreign earnings and a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate can be found in Notes 10 and 14 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued OperationsMotorola MobileOn October 29, 2014, we closed the sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including $1.4 billion paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares. The remaining $1.5 billion was paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.We maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including pre-closing patent applications and invention disclosures, which we licensed to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we agreed to indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business, for which we recorded a liability of $130 million as of December 31, 2014.The sale resulted in a gain of $740 million, net of tax, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Incremental to this net gain, we recognized an additional income of $254 million, net of tax, in connection with certain IP licensing arrangements between the parties, included as part of net income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.The financial results of Motorola Mobile through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Quarterly Results of OperationsThe following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. Please note that previously reported quarters have been adjusted to show discontinued operations for the sale of the Motorola Mobile and Motorola Home businesses.  In addition, per share amounts for the previously reported quarters below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. Please see Note 1 and Note 12 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Stock Split.The following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2014. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates. 31Table of Contents Quarter Ended Mar 31,2013 Jun 30,2013 Sep 30,2013 Dec 31,2013 Mar 31,2014 Jun 30,2014 Sep 30,2014 Dec 31,2014 (In millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Consolidated Statements of Income Data:               Revenues$12,951 $13,107 $13,754 $15,707 $15,420 $15,955 $16,523 $18,103Costs and expenses:               Cost of revenues5,136 5,195 5,409 6,253 5,961 6,114 6,695 6,921Research and development1,617 1,766 1,821 1,933 2,126 2,238 2,655 2,813Sales and marketing1,435 1,583 1,628 1,908 1,729 1,941 2,084 2,377General and administrative1,015 1,098 1,135 1,184 1,489 1,404 1,365 1,593Total costs and expenses9,203 9,642 9,993 11,278 11,305 11,697 12,799 13,704Income from operations3,748 3,465 3,761 4,429 4,115 4,258 3,724 4,399Interest and other income, net134 236 14 112 357 145 133 128Income from continuing operations before income taxes3,882 3,701 3,775 4,541 4,472 4,403 3,857 4,527Provision for income taxes354 927 612 659 822 913 859 737Net income from continuing operations$3,528 $2,774 $3,163 $3,882 $3,650 $3,490 $2,998 $3,790Net income (loss) from discontinued operations(182) 454 (193) (506) (198) (68) (185) 967Net income$3,346 $3,228 $2,970 $3,376 $3,452 $3,422 $2,813 $4,757Net income (loss) per share - basic:               Continuing operations$5.34 $4.17 $4.74 $5.80 $5.42 $5.17 $4.42 $5.58Discontinued operations(0.28) 0.68 (0.29) (0.76) (0.29) (0.10) (0.27) 1.43Net income per share - basic$5.06 $4.85 $4.45 $5.04 $5.13 $5.07 $4.15 $7.01Net income (loss) per share - diluted:               Continuing operations$5.24 $4.10 $4.66 $5.69 $5.33 $5.09 $4.36 $5.50Discontinued operations(0.27) 0.67 (0.28) (0.74) (0.29) (0.10) (0.27) 1.41Net income per share - diluted$4.97 $4.77 $4.38 $4.95 $5.04 $4.99 $4.09 $6.9132Table of ContentsThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2014: Quarter Ended Mar 31,2013 Jun 30,2013 Sep 30,2013 Dec 31,2013 Mar 31,2014 Jun 30,2014 Sep 30,2014 Dec 31,2014Revenues100.0 % 100.0% 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0%Costs and expenses:               Cost of revenues39.7 39.6 39.3 39.8 38.7 38.3 40.5 38.2Research and development12.5 13.5 13.2 12.3 13.8 14.0 16.1 15.5Sales and marketing11.1 12.1 11.8 12.1 11.2 12.2 12.6 13.1General and administrative7.8 8.4 8.3 7.5 9.7 8.8 8.3 8.8Total costs and expenses71.1 73.6 72.6 71.7 73.4 73.3 77.5 75.6Income from operations28.9 26.4 27.4 28.3 26.6 26.7 22.5 24.3Interest and other income, net1.0 1.8 0.1 0.7 2.3 0.9 0.8 0.7Income from continuing operations before income taxes29.9 28.2 27.5 29.0 28.9 27.6 23.3 25.0Provision for income taxes2.7 7.1 4.4 4.2 5.3 5.7 5.2 4.1Net income from continuing operations27.2 % 21.1% 23.1 % 24.8 % 23.6 % 21.9 % 18.1 % 20.9%Net income (loss) from discontinued operations(1.4) 3.5 (1.4) (3.2) (1.3) (0.4) (1.1) 5.3Net income25.8 % 24.6% 21.7 % 21.6 % 22.3 % 21.5 % 17.0 % 26.2%Capital Resources and LiquidityCapital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2014, we had $64.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, fixed-income bond funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public, which we generally dispose of when restrictions are lifted.As of December 31, 2014, $38.7 billion of the $64.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had unused letters of credit of approximately $842 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions, increase our capital expenditures, or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities. Additional financing may not be available or on terms favorable to us.We have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% that matures at various dates through April 2015. Average commercial paper borrowings during the year were $2.1 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $2.4 billion. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving 33Table of Contentscredit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility and no amounts were outstanding.In May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2011 Notes) in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In February 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2014 Notes) due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 Notes that matured in May 2014 and for general corporate purposes.As of December 31, 2014, the 2011 and 2014 notes had a total carrying value of $3.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.1 billion. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.In August 2013, we entered into a $258 million capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2014.LiquidityFor 2012, 2013 and 2014, our cash flows were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$16,619 $18,659 $22,376Net cash used in investing activities(13,056) (13,679) (21,055)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,229 (857) (1,439)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesOur largest source of cash provided by our operations is advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of digital content and licensing payments. Prior to its divestiture, we also generated cash from sales of hardware products related to the Motorola Mobile business.Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. Prior to the sale of the Motorola Mobile business, our use of cash also included payment for manufacturing and inventory-related costs in the Motorola Mobile business. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for depreciation and loss on disposal of property and equipment and stock-based compensation expense, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital primarily driven by changes in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets.Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for gain on divestiture of businesses, depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by the net decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily as a result of a decrease in income taxes, an increase in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by an increase in accounts payable.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets. Our cash provided or used in investing activities includes purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio and our investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program.Cash used in investing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases, higher spend related to acquisitions, and lower proceeds received in 2014 from divestiture of businesses compared to 2013. This increase was partially offset by a net decrease in purchases of marketable securities.34Table of ContentsCash used in investing activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of marketable securities and an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases. This increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions and an increase in proceeds received from divestiture of businesses.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt and net proceeds or payments and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities.Cash used in financing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily driven by an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities, offset partially by a decrease in net cash payments related to debt.Cash used in financing activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily driven by an increase in net cash payments related to debt and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net payments for stock-based award activities.Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2014 Payments Due By Period Total Less than1 year 1-3years 3-5years More than5 years (in millions)Operating lease obligations, net of sublease income amounts$6,183 $598 $1,256 $1,172 $3,157Purchase obligations 2,700 1,735 465 154 346Long-term debt obligations, including capital lease obligations3,843 107 1,390 140 2,206Possible Adjustment Payment to Class C capital stockholders593 593 0 0 0Other long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet954 212 441 89 212Total contractual obligations$14,273 $3,245 $3,552 $1,555 $5,921Operating LeasesWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2015 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. In October 2014, we entered into certain non-cancelable office lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2027 and 2028 where we will be the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Future minimum lease payments under the leases total approximately $1.0 billion, of which $250 million is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 as a an asset and corresponding non-current liability, which represents our estimate of construction costs incurred, and the balance of which is included in the schedule above.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014. These contracts are primarily related to video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as purchase of inventory.Long-term Debt ObligationsLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior notes issued in May 2011 and May 2014, and our capital lease obligation incurred in August 2013. Please see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Possible Adjustment Payment to Class C Capital StockholdersIn accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first 35Table of Contents365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014. Please see Note 12 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Possible Adjustment Payment.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesOther long-term liabilities represent cash obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities and consist primarily of payments owed in connection with certain investments and asset retirement obligations.In addition to the amounts above, we had long-term taxes payable of $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2014, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.Please see Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the summary of significant accounting policies.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.Loss ContingenciesWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, indirect taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably 36Table of Contentsestimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.GoodwillGoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. As of December 31, 2014, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived AssetsLong-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable SecuritiesWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.37Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency.  As of December 31, 2014, our most significant currency exposures are the British pound, Euro, and Japanese Yen.We use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.  The fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values. Changes in the time value are recorded in interest and other income, net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2013 and 2014, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $4 million and $686 million lower at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $123 million and $90 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 20013 and December 31, 2014, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion higher at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $120 million and $164 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.  These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in "Interest and other income, net," which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $52 million and $93 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. The adverse impact at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $853 million and $948 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.Interest Rate RiskOur investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in fixed rate securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities,  mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, asset backed securities, municipal securities, time deposits and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to the fixed interest rates on our debt securities. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold.  We use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge realized gains and losses on our securities. These derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest and other income, net. 38Table of ContentsWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, after taking into consideration the offsetting effect from interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. 39Table of ContentsITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAGoogle Inc.INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   PageReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm41Financial Statements: Consolidated Balance Sheets43Consolidated Statements of Income44Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income45Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity46Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows47Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements48The supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly Results of Operations.”40Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 6, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLP   San Jose, California February 6, 2015 41Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.We have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December

Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of OperationsWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.On April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business (Motorola Home) to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris). The financial results of Motorola Home are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. See Note 8 for further discussion of the sale.On April 2, 2014, we completed a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend (the Stock Split). All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. See Notes 11 and 12 for additional information about the Stock Split.On October 29, 2014, we sold the Motorola Mobile business (Motorola Mobile) to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo). The financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. See Note 8 for further discussion of the sale.Basis of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Revenue RecognitionThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Advertising revenues:     Google websites$31,221 $37,422 $45,085Google Network Members' websites12,465 13,125 13,971Total advertising revenues43,686 50,547 59,056Other revenues2,353 4,972 6,945Revenues$46,039 $55,519 $66,001We generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising, and we recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us on a cost-per-engagement basis, for example, when a user engages in their ads. Brand advertising enhances users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and other ads that run across various devices. 48Table of ContentsGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables performance advertisers to place text-based and display ads on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer advertising on a cost-per-impression basis that enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.We recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.For hardware product sales, where we sell directly to end customers or through distribution channels, revenue recognition generally occurs when products have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. Where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.For the sale of certain third-party products and services, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share. Generally, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. We generally record the net amounts as revenue earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have inventory risk or latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are typically determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed fee, or a combination of the two.For arrangements that include multiple deliverables, primarily for products that contain software essential to the hardware products’ functionality and services, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.We record deferred revenues upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.Cost of Revenues       Cost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.      Additionally, other costs of revenues includes the following:•Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (We share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);•The expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs);•Inventory costs for hardware we sell;•Stock-based compensation paid to our employees;•Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; and•Amortization of certain intangible assets.Stock-based CompensationRestricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number 49Table of Contentsof RSUs outstanding. We record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us primarily as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. For stock option awards outstanding in the periods presented, we determined fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model on the dates of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method over the vesting period.We include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $736 million, $1,174 million, and $465 million, respectively, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $747 million, $1,195 million, and $1,356 million, respectively. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards -- primarily the research and development tax credit -- through the Consolidated Statements of Income.For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we recognized stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations and related tax benefits of $2,473 million and $545 million, $3,127 million and $685 million, and $4,175 million and $867 million, respectively. Additionally, net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, includes stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $219 million and $57 million, $216 million and $59 million, and $104 million and $30 million, respectively.Certain Risks and ConcentrationsOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, we generated approximately 46%, 45%, and 43% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2012, 2013, or 2014.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsOur financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain other assets including our non-marketable equity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value and are therefore not recorded at fair value.Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable SecuritiesWe invest our excess cash primarily in time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable 50Table of Contentssecurities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.Non-Marketable Equity SecuritiesWe have accounted for non-marketable equity securities either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.Impairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable SecuritiesWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.Accounts ReceivableWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.Property and EquipmentWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.Software Development CostsWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products are not material.Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.Business CombinationsWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based 51Table of Contentson their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. In 2014, we recorded impairments of intangible assets, including an impairment of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. No goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presented.Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years.Income TaxesWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.Foreign CurrencyGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end spot rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in interest and other income, net. Advertising and Promotional ExpensesWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $1,992 million, $2,389 million, and $3,004 million.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 (ASU 2014-08) “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity." ASU 2014-08 raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. It is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-08 to be material to our consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) "Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation". ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities. The amendment eliminating the exception to the sufficiency-of-equity-at-risk criterion for development stage entities should be applied retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning 52Table of Contentsafter December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein. Early application of these amendments is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-10 on our consolidated financial statements.Prior Period ReclassificationsReclassifications of prior period amounts related to discontinued operations as a result of the sale of Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses, and share and per share amounts due to the Stock Split have been made to conform to the current period presentation.Note 2.    Financial Instruments Fair Value MeasurementsWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.  Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 (in millions):53Table of Contents  As of December 31, 2013  AdjustedCost GrossUnrealizedGains GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue Cash andCashEquivalents MarketableSecuritiesCash $9,909 $0 $0 $9,909 $9,909 $0Level 1:            Money market and other funds 4,428 0 0 4,428 4,428 0U.S. government notes 18,276 23 (37) 18,262 2,501 15,761Marketable equity securities 197 167 0 364 0 364  22,901 190 (37) 23,054 6,929 16,125Level 2:            Time deposits(1) 1,207 0 0 1,207 790 417Money market and other funds(2) 1,270 0 0 1,270 1,270 0U.S. government agencies 4,575 3 (3) 4,575 0 4,575Foreign government bonds 1,502 5 (26) 1,481 0 1,481Municipal securities 2,904 9 (36) 2,877 0 2,877Corporate debt securities 7,300 162 (67) 7,395 0 7,395Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 5,969 27 (187) 5,809 0 5,809Asset-backed securities 1,142 0 (2) 1,140 0 1,140  25,869 206 (321) 25,754 2,060 23,694Total $58,679 $396 $(358) $58,717 $18,898 $39,819  As of December 31, 2014  AdjustedCost GrossUnrealizedGains GrossUnrealizedLosses FairValue Cash andCashEquivalents MarketableSecuritiesCash $9,863 $0 $0 $9,863 $9,863 $0Level 1:            Money market and other funds 2,532 0 0 2,532 2,532 0U.S. government notes 15,320 37 (4) 15,353 1,128 14,225Marketable equity securities 988 428 (64) 1,352 0 1,352  18,840 465 (68) 19,237 3,660 15,577Level 2:            Time deposits(1) 2,409 0 0 2,409 2,309 100Money market and other funds(2) 1,762 0 0 1,762 1,762 0Fixed-income bond funds(3) 385 0 (38) 347 0 347U.S. government agencies 2,327 8 (1) 2,334 750 1,584Foreign government bonds 1,828 22 (10) 1,840 0 1,840Municipal securities 3,370 33 (6) 3,397 3 3,394Corporate debt securities 11,499 114 (122) 11,491 0 11,491Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 8,196 109 (42) 8,263 0 8,263Asset-backed securities 3,456 1 (5) 3,452 0 3,452  35,232 287 (224) 35,295 4,824 30,471Total $63,935 $752 $(292) $64,395 $18,347 $46,048(1) The majority of our time deposits are foreign deposits.(2) The balances as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were related to cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion of this program.(3) Fixed-income bond funds consist of mutual funds that primarily invest in corporate and government bonds.54Table of ContentsDuring the second quarter of 2013, we received approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares) in connection with the disposition of Motorola Home and during the fourth quarter of 2014, we received $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (519.1 million shares) in connection with the disposition of Motorola Mobile (see details in Note 8). These shares are accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $383 million, $416 million, and $238 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We recognized gross realized losses of $101 million, $258 million, and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions): As of December 31, 2014Due in 1 year$4,547Due in 1 year through 5 years24,123Due in 5 years through 10 years7,083Due after 10 years8,596Total$44,349The following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):   As of December 31, 2013  Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total  Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLossU.S. government notes $4,404 $(37) $0 $0 $4,404 $(37)U.S. government agencies 496 (3) 0 0 496 (3)Foreign government bonds 899 (23) 83 (3) 982 (26)Municipal securities 1,210 (32) 99 (4) 1,309 (36)Corporate debt securities 2,583 (62) 69 (5) 2,652 (67)Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 4,065 (167) 468 (20) 4,533 (187)Asset-backed securities 643 (2) 0 0 643 (2)Total $14,300 $(326) $719 $(32) $15,019 $(358)  As of December 31, 2014  Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total  Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLossU.S. government notes $4,490 $(4) $0 $0 $4,490 $(4)U.S. government agencies 830 (1) 0 0 830 (1)Foreign government bonds 255 (7) 43 (3) 298 (10)Municipal securities 877 (3) 174 (3) 1,051 (6)Corporate debt securities 5,851 (112) 225 (10) 6,076 (122)Agency residential mortgage-backed securities 609 (1) 2,168 (41) 2,777 (42)Asset-backed securities 2,388 (4) 174 (1) 2,562 (5)Fixed-income bond funds 347 (38) 0 0 347 (38)Marketable equity securities 690 (64) 0 0 690 (64)Total $16,337 $(234) $2,784 $(58) $19,121 $(292)55Table of ContentsWe periodically review our marketable debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell.  For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss. Non-Marketable Equity InvestmentsOur non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and those investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $1.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. For investments accounted for under the cost method, we concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment.  No material impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. Securities Lending ProgramFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.   For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default. Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below.We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and our anticipated debt issuance. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default.  As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $35 million and $268 million.Cash Flow HedgesWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $10.0 billion and $13.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.In 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate, that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014. We issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in February 2014 (See details in Note 3). As a result, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swaps upon the debt issuance. The gain associated with the termination is reported within Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014, consistent with the impact of the hedged item. We reflect gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. 56Table of ContentsIf the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to interest and other income, net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in interest and other income, net.As of December 31, 2014, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $817 million, of which $645 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.Fair Value HedgesWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.Starting in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, we used interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $175 million as of December 31, 2014.Gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in interest and other income net along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items.Other DerivativesOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $9.4 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $13 million and $150 million as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.The fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):57Table of Contents    As of December 31, 2013   Balance Sheet Location Fair Value ofDerivativesDesignated asHedging Instruments Fair Value ofDerivatives NotDesignated asHedging Instruments Total FairValueDerivative Assets:        Level 2:        Foreign exchange contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current $133 $12 $145Interest rate contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current 87 0 87Total   $220 $12 $232Derivative Liabilities:        Level 2:        Foreign exchange contracts Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $0 $4 $4    As of December 31, 2014   Balance Sheet Location Fair Value ofDerivativesDesignated asHedging Instruments Fair Value ofDerivatives NotDesignated asHedging Instruments Total FairValueDerivative Assets:        Level 2:        Foreign exchange contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current $851 $0 $851Interest rate contracts Prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, current and non-current 1 0 1Total   $852 $0 $852Derivative Liabilities:         Level 2:        Foreign exchange contracts Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $0 $3 $3Interest rate contracts Accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and non-current 1 0 1Total    $1 $3 $458Table of ContentsThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income (OCI) is summarized below (in millions):  Gains (Losses) Recognized in OCIon Derivatives Before Tax Effect (Effective Portion)  Year Ended December 31,Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship 2012 2013 2014Foreign exchange contracts $73 $92 $929Interest rate contracts 1 86 (31)Total $74 $178 $898   Gains Reclassified from AOCI into Income (Effective Portion)    Year Ended December 31,Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship Location 2012 2013 2014Foreign exchange contracts Revenues $217 $95 $171Interest rate contracts Interest and other income, net 0 0 $4Total    $217 $95 $175  Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives (AmountExcluded from  Effectiveness Testing and Ineffective Portion)      (1)    Year Ended December 31,Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationship Location 2012 2013 2014Foreign exchange contracts Interest andother income, net $(447) $(280) $(279)Interest rate contracts Interest and other income, net 0 0 $4Total    $(447) $(280) $(275)(1)Gains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.The effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):  Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives(2)    Year Ended December 31,Derivatives in Fair Value Hedging Relationship Location 2012 2013 2014Foreign exchange contracts Interest andother income, net $(31) $16 $115Hedged item Interest andother income, net 23 (25) (123)Total   $(8) $(9) $(8)(2)Losses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $8 million, $9 million, and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. 59Table of ContentsThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):  Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income on Derivatives    Year Ended December 31,Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments Location 2012 2013 2014Foreign exchange contracts Interest andother income, net $(67) $118 $237Interest rate contracts Interest andother income, net (6) 4 2Total   $(73) $122 $239Offsetting of Derivatives, Securities Lending, and Reverse Repurchase AgreementsWe present our derivatives, securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 3.    Debt Short-Term DebtWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% for both periods. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.Long-Term DebtWe issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the "2014 Notes") in February 2014 and $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the "2011 Notes") in May 2011. On May 19, 2014, we repaid $1.0 billion on the first tranche of our 2011 Notes upon their maturity. Additionally, we entered into a capital lease obligation in August 2013. The details of these financing arrangements are described in the table below (in millions): 61Table of Contents Outstanding Balance As of December 31, 2013 Outstanding Balance As of December 31, 2014Short-term portion of long-term debt: 1.25% Notes due on May 19, 2014$1,000 $0Capital lease obligation9 10 Total$1,009 $10    Long-term debt:   2.125% Notes due on May 19, 20161,000 1,0003.625% Notes due on May 19, 20211,000 1,0003.375% Notes due on February 25, 20240 1,000Unamortized discount for the Notes above(10) (8)Subtotal1,990 2,992Capital lease obligation246 236Total$2,236 $3,228The effective interest yields of the Notes due in 2016, 2021, and 2024 were 2.241%, 3.734% and 3.377%, respectively. Interest on the 2011 and 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually. The 2011 and 2014 Notes rank equally with each other and with all of our other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. We may redeem the 2011 and 2014 Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the 2011 Notes or the 2014 Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the 2011 and 2014 Notes was approximately $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. The fair value of the outstanding 2011 and 2014 Notes was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase the property in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate.  The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.As of December 31, 2014, aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt (including short-term portion of long-term debt) and capital lease obligation were as follows (in millions):Years ending  2015 $102016 1,2362017 02018 0Thereafter 2,000Total $3,24662Table of ContentsNote 4.

Acquisitions 2014 AcquisitionsNestIn February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Nest Labs, Inc. (Nest), a company whose mission is to reinvent devices in the home such as thermostats and smoke alarms. Prior to this transaction, we had an approximately 12% ownership interest in Nest. The acquisition is expected to enhance Google's suite of products and services and allow Nest to continue to innovate upon devices in the home, making them more useful, intuitive, and thoughtful, and to reach more users in more countries.  Of the total $2.6 billion purchase price and the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $152 million, $51 million was cash acquired, $430 million was attributed to intangible assets, $2.3 billion was attributed to goodwill, and $84 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $2.3 billion is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.This transaction is considered a “step acquisition” under GAAP whereby our ownership interest in Nest held before the acquisition was remeasured to fair value at the date of the acquisition. Such fair value was estimated by using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Inputs used in the methodologies primarily included projected future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. The gain of $103 million as a result of remeasurement is included in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.DropcamIn July 2014, Nest completed the acquisition of Dropcam, Inc. (Dropcam), a company that enables consumers and businesses to monitor their homes and offices via video, for approximately $517 million in cash. With Dropcam on board, Nest expects to continue to reinvent products that will help shape the future of the connected home. Of the total purchase price of $517 million, $11 million was cash acquired, $55 million was attributed to intangible assets, $452 million was attributed to goodwill, and $1 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $452 million is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.SkyboxIn August 2014, we completed the acquisition of Skybox Imaging, Inc. (Skybox), a satellite imaging company, for approximately $478 million in cash. We expect the acquisition to keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery and, over time, improve internet access and disaster relief. Of the total purchase price of $478 million, $6 million was cash acquired, $69 million was attributed to intangible assets, $388 million was attributed to goodwill, and $15 million was attributed to net assets acquired. The goodwill of $388 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Other AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $1,466 million, which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $33 million. In aggregate, $65 million was cash acquired, $405 million was attributed to intangible assets, $1,045 million was attributed to goodwill, and $49 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $55 million.Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.For all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2014, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 5.1 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.9 years.2013 AcquisitionsIn June 2013, we completed our acquisition of Waze Limited (Waze), a provider of a mobile map application which provides turn-by-turn navigation and real-time traffic updates powered by incidents and route information submitted by a community of users, for a total cash consideration of $969 million. The acquisition is expected to enhance our customers' user experience by offering real time traffic information to meet users' daily navigation needs.  Of the total purchase price, $841 million was attributed to goodwill and $193 million was attributed to intangible assets, offset by $65 million of other net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $841 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total consideration of approximately $489 million, of which $268 million was attributed to intangible assets, $238 million to goodwill, and $17 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $38 million.Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.For all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2013, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.8 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 5.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.5 years.Note 6.    Collaboration Agreement On September 18, 2013, we announced the formation of Calico, a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. Calico's results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 64Table of Contents31, 2014, Google has contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units. As of December 31, 2014, Google has also committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis.In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including for neurodegeneration and cancer. As of December 31, 2014, AbbVie and Calico have each contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement. Calico will use its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies will share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years. On January 15, 2015, AbbVie contributed an additional $500 million to Calico which reflects the remainder of its $750 million commitment to Calico.Note 7.

Amortization expense relating to our purchased intangible assets was $744 million, $1,011 million, and $1,079 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge in other cost of revenues of $378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition, which Google retained subsequent to the sale of Motorola Mobile. The asset was determined to be impaired due to prolonged decreased royalty payments and 65Table of Contentsunpaid interest owed and was written down to its fair value. Fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow method and reflects estimated future cash flows associated with the patent licensing royalty asset at the measurement date and falls within level 3 in fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2014, expected amortization expense for our purchased intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions): 2015$8652016784201770420186332019524Thereafter1,097 $4,607Note 8.    Discontinued Operations Motorola MobileOn October 29, 2014, we closed the sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including $1.4 billion paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (519.1 million shares). The remaining $1.5 billion was paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.We maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including pre-closing patent applications and invention disclosures, which we licensed to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we agreed to indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business, for which we recorded a liability of $130 million as of December 31, 2014.The sale resulted in a gain of $740 million, net of tax, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Incremental to this net gain, we recognized an additional income of $254 million, net of tax, in connection with certain IP licensing arrangements between the parties, included as part of net income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.The financial results of Motorola Mobile through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Commitments and Contingencies Operating LeasesWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2015 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.68Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2014, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions): OperatingLeases Sub-leaseIncome NetOperatingLeases2015628 30 5982016643 21 6222017644 10 6342018597 1 5962019576 0 576Thereafter3,157 0 3,157Total minimum payments$6,245 $62$6,183Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. In October 2014, we entered into certain non-cancelable office lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2027 and 2028 where we will be the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Future minimum lease payments under the leases total approximately $1.0 billion of which $250 million is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 as an asset and corresponding non-current liability, which represents our estimate of construction costs incurred, and the balance of which is included in the schedule above.Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $417 million, $465 million, and $570 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014.Purchase ObligationsAs of December 31, 2014, we had $2.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as certain inventory purchase commitments.Possible Adjustment Payment to Class C Capital StockholdersIn accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first 365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014. Please see Note 12 for additional information related to the Possible Adjustment Payment.Letters of CreditAs of December 31, 2014, we had unused letters of credit for $842 million.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that 69Table of Contentsvalid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. As part of the sale of Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses, we issued indemnifications for certain potential liabilities. Please see Note 8 for additional information.Legal MattersAntitrust InvestigationsOn November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. We believe we have adequately responded to all of the allegations made against us and continue to cooperate with the EC.The Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Brazil's Council for Economic Defense and the Canadian Competition Bureau have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices.The state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests. In November 2014, the Ohio Attorney General's office informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigation, which began in May 2011, of our business practices. In May 2014, the Texas Attorney General's office informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigation, which began in July 2010, of our business practices.Patent and Intellectual Property ClaimsWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.OtherWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending investigation by the EC described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.Certain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.70Table of ContentsWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.TaxesWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it would result in a further charge to expense.Please see Note 14 for additional information regarding contingencies related to our income taxes.Note 11.    Net Income Per ShareWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. The net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented below have been retroactively restated to reflect the Stock Split. Please see Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information on the Stock Split.The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):71Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2012 Class A Class B Class CBasic net income (loss) per share:     Numerator     Allocation of undistributed earnings -

Stockholders’ Equity Convertible Preferred StockOur board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, there were no shares issued or outstanding.Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital StockOur board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.74Table of ContentsStock Split Effected In Form of Stock DividendIn April 2012, our board of directors approved amendments to our certificate of incorporation that created a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock). The amendments authorized 3 billion shares of Class C capital stock and also increased the authorized shares of Class A common stock from 6 billion to 9 billion. The amendments are reflected in our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (New Charter), the adoption of which was approved by stockholders at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012. In January 2014, our board of directors approved a distribution of shares of the Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock (the Stock Split). The Stock Split had a record date of March 27, 2014 and a payment date of April 2, 2014. Share and per share amounts disclosed as of December 31, 2014 and for all other comparative periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Except as expressly provided in the New Charter, shares of Class C capital stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all other respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as to all matters including dividend and distribution rights.In accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first 365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. The amount of the Possible Adjustment Payment is dependent on the percentage difference that develops, if any, between the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Class A and Class C shares during the Lookback Period, as supplied by NASDAQ Data-on-Demand. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the VWAP of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014.At the end of the Lookback Period, the Possible Adjustment Payment, if any, will be allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to shareholders and any remaining undistributed earnings will be allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. In addition, the dilutive impact of the Possible Adjustment Payment, if any, is included in the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities for Class C capital stock in the year ended December 31, 2014.The par value per share of our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock remained unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. On the effective date of the Stock Split, a transfer between retained earnings and common stock occurred in an amount equal to the $0.001 par value of the Class C capital stock that was issued.Stock PlansDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, shares reserved for future grants under the 2004 Stock Plan expired and we began granting awards from the 2012 Stock Plan (“Stock Plan”). Under our Stock Plan, RSUs or stock options may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time the award vests. Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options and RSUs granted to participants under the Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date.As of December 31, 2014, there were 17,525,225 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan.Stock-Based ActivitiesWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock price volatility were based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimated the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 was $97.14 and $107.20, respectively. No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2014. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted in the periods presented:75Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Risk-free interest rate1.0% 0.9% N/AExpected volatility29% 29% N/AExpected life (in years)5.2 5.8 N/ADividend yield0 0 N/AThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2014:  Options Outstanding Number ofShares Weighted-AverageExercisePrice Weighted-AverageRemainingContractualTerm(in years) AggregateIntrinsicValue(in millions)(1)Balance at December 31, 201310,065,726 $215.50    Granted0 N/A    Exercised(2,328,965) $199.84    Forfeited/canceled(496,342) $293.31    Balance at December 31, 20147,240,419 $215.56 4.3 $2,266Exercisable as of December 31, 20146,213,230 $199.57 3.9 $2,044Exercisable as of December 31, 2014 and expected to vest thereafter(2)7,129,380 $214.06 4.3 $2,242(1)  The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock prices of $530.66 and $526.40 of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, respectively, on December 31, 2014.(2)  Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2012, 2013, and 2014 was $489 million, $223 million, and $94 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2012, 2013, and 2014 was $827 million, $1,793 million, and $589 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our Transferable Stock Options (TSO) program, which was discontinued as of November 29, 2013.As of December 31, 2014, there was $56 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2014: Unvested Restricted Stock Units     Number of    Shares Weighted-AverageGrant-DateFair ValueUnvested at December 31, 201321,953,960 $359.20Granted15,520,343 $573.71Vested(10,742,740) $361.92Forfeited/canceled(2,112,014) $420.28Unvested at December 31, 201424,619,549 $487.80Expected to vest after December 31, 2014 (1)21,958,176 $487.80(1) RSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.As of December 31, 2014, there was $9.7 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs.

To the extent the actual 76Table of Contentsforfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.Note 13.    401(k) Plans We have two 401(k) Savings Plans (401(k) Plans) that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $164 million, $202 million, and $259 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.Note 14.    Income Taxes Income from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $6,447 million, $7,044 million, and $7,936 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, and income from foreign operations of $8,021 million, $8,855 million, and $9,323 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Current:     Federal$2,484 $2,217 $2,424State169 117 140Foreign312 711 774Total2,965 3,045 3,338Deferred:     Federal(109) (421) 29State5 0 7Foreign55 (72) (43)Total(49) (493) (7)Provision for income taxes$2,916 $2,552 $3,331The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Expected provision at federal statutory tax rate (35%)$5,064 $5,567 $6,041State taxes, net of federal benefit114 123 115Change in valuation allowance1,921 (641) (164)Foreign rate differential(2,208) (2,659) (2,400)Federal research credit0 (433) (318)Basis difference in investment of Arris(1,960) 644 0Other adjustments(15) (49) 57Provision for income taxes$2,916 $2,552 $3,331A one-year retroactive extension of the research credit from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014, was signed into law on December 19, 2014 in accordance with the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. A retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit was signed into law on January 2, 2013 in accordance with The American Taxpayer Act of 2012. The benefit of $189 million related to the 2012 federal research and development credit is included in the year ended December 31, 2013.We have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount of earnings upon 77Table of Contentswhich U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $47.4 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2013 2014Deferred tax assets:   Stock-based compensation expense$283 $376State taxes204 133Investment loss266 133Legal settlement accruals45 175Accrued employee benefits477 671Accruals and reserves not currently deductible390 175Net operating losses279 207Tax credits394 262Basis difference in investment of Arris1,372 1,347Other250 243Total deferred tax assets3,960 3,722Valuation allowance(1,899) (1,659)Total deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance2,061 2,063Deferred tax liabilities:   Depreciation and amortization(537) (852)Identified intangibles(1,479) (965)Mark-to-market investments6 (273)Renewable energy investments(223) (430)Other(185) (123)Total deferred tax liabilities(2,418) (2,643)Net deferred tax liabilities$(357) $(580)As of December 31, 2014, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $554 million and $400 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.As of December 31, 2014, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $734 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.As of December 31, 2014, our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $82 million, which will start to expire in 2021.  We believe it is more likely than not that all of the foreign tax credit will be realized.  We will reassess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence supports a need to establish a valuation allowance, then a tax expense will be recorded accordingly.As of December 31, 2014, we fully utilized our federal capital loss carryforwards for income tax purpose. On the other hand, our state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purpose as of December 31, 2014 were $379 million. We also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in nature. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state deferred tax assets for these items. 78Table of ContentsWe will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris for the sale of the Motorola Home business. A deferred tax asset was established for the book-to-tax basis difference in our investment in the Motorola Home business upon signing the agreement because the basis difference was going to be recognized in the foreseeable future. In April 2013, upon the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris, our basis difference in the Motorola Home business became a basis difference in Google’s investment in Arris shares received in the sale and was adjusted by the amount of cash received as part of the transaction.  Since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale of Arris shares will be capital losses, a valuation allowance was recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not covered by capital gain generated during 2014. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 (in millions):Balance as of January 1, 2012$1,564Increases related to prior year tax positions60Decreases related to prior year tax positions(40)Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities(62)Increases related to current year tax positions411Balance as of December 31, 20121,933Increases related to prior year tax positions158Decreases related to prior year tax positions(37)Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities(78)Increases related to current year tax positions595Balance as of December 31, 20132,571Increases related to prior year tax positions66Decreases related to prior year tax positions(44)Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities(1)Increases related to current year tax positions820Balance as of December 31, 2014$3,412Our total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $1,749 million, $2,378 million, and $3,026 million as of December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, we had accrued $181 million and $215 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes.We and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and settlements were reached in 2012 on all but one issue which we plan to litigate in court. As a result we released the related reserves in the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. We expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months, but we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2014, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years.Our 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2010 through 2014 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment.  We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.  While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.  Note 15.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas Subsequent to the completion of our sale of the Motorola Mobile business on October 29, 2014, we operate as a single operating segment. Our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2013 2014Revenues:     United States$21,287 $24,752 $28,139United Kingdom4,846 5,600 6,483Rest of the world19,906 25,167 31,379Total revenues$46,039 $55,519 $66,001 As of December 31, 2013 (1) 2014Long-lived assets:   United States$24,004 $37,355International14,030 13,093Total long-lived assets$38,034 $50,448(1) Includes the long-lived assets from the Motorola Mobile segment as of December 31, 2013.Note 16.    Subsequent EventInvestment in SpaceXOn January 20, 2015, we invested $900 million in SpaceX, a space exploration and space transport company, to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing. We are currently evaluating the transaction and its impact on our financial statements.ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURENone.ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and ProceduresIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.ITEM 9B.OTHER INFORMATIONNone.PART IIIITEM 10.DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe information required by this item will be included under the caption “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” in our Proxy Statement for the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (2015 Proxy Statement) and is incorporated herein by reference.
