ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview and Outlook

Colgate-Palmolive Company seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.

To this end, the Company is tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, the Company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. These product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization’s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.

Operationally, the Company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. The Company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the Company’s sales and profitability. Approximately 80% of the Company’s Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 50% of the Company’s Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Greater Asia/Africa (excluding Japan) and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the Company’s exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.

The Oral, Personal and Home Care segment is operated through four reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe/South Pacific and Greater Asia/Africa, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. The Company, through Hill’s Pet Nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through specialty pet retailers and the veterinary profession.

On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include market share, Net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), Gross profit margin, Operating profit, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per common share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. The monitoring of these indicators and the Company’s Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.

To achieve its business and financial objectives, the Company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. The Company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. To enhance these efforts, the Company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. Growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the Company’s products.

The investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, the Company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses and distribution and logistics, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. The Company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.

As disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” with approximately 80% of its Net sales generated outside of the United States, the Company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political and economic uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. For example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in Venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price controls, labor disruptions and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources.

15




In particular, the Company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013, described in Note 14 “Venezuela” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency, and effective on February 9, 2013 the official exchange rate changed from 4.30 to 6.30 per dollar. This devaluation had no impact on the Company's 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's preliminary assessment of the one-time impact of the devaluation is that the Company will incur an aftertax loss of approximately $120 ($0.25 per common share) in the first quarter of 2013, related to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. There will also be ongoing impacts primarily related to the remeasurement of the local financial statements at the new exchange rate. We will remeasure the financial statements of CP Venezuela for 2013 at 6.30, the rate at which we now expect to remit dividends. While it is difficult to project, it is the Company's preliminary estimate that these ongoing impacts will reduce diluted earnings per common share by $0.05 to $0.07 per share per quarter in 2013 taking into account both the Company's ability to take actions in Venezuela and elsewhere to mitigate the effect of the devaluation and ongoing price control regulations in Venezuela.

In addition, the Venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls and price controls. While CP Venezuela continues to have limited access to U.S. dollars from the government (CADIVI), and currently only for imported goods, the timing of receipt of these funds has slowed and become increasingly unpredictable. CP Venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of U.S. dollars obtained from CADIVI, intercompany borrowings and the use of financial and other intermediaries and, to a lesser extent, with existing U.S. dollar cash balances, which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its U.S. dollar-denominated bond portfolio. On April 1, 2012, additional price controls became effective, affecting most products in CP Venezuela’s portfolio, thereby further restricting the Company’s ability to implement price increases, which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation. In the fourth quarter of 2012, production at CP Venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country.

The Company’s business in Venezuela, and the Company’s ability to repatriate its earnings, continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange, pricing or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest. Following the February 2013 devaluation, CP Venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary asset position, which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation, was reduced to approximately $390 as compared to approximately $520 at December 31, 2012, and it is expected that CP Venezuela will represent less than 4% of the Company's consolidated Net sales in 2013. The Company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to Venezuela.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program (the 2012 Restructuring Program) for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses. Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2016, is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax). Savings are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 pretax ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. For more information regarding the 2012 Restructuring Program, see “Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges” below.

In 2012, the Company incurred aftertax costs of $14 associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives and aftertax costs of $18 related to the sale of land in Mexico (discussed below).

On September 13, 2011, the Company’s Mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the United States of America the Mexico City site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility are located. The sale price is payable in three installments, with the final installment due upon the transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company is re-investing these payments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility to be constructed at its Mission Hills, Mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within Mexico City and to prepare the existing site for transfer. As a result, the Company expects to make capital improvements and incur costs to exit the site through 2014. These exit costs will primarily be related to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready.

On July 29, 2011, in connection with the Sanex acquisition (discussed below), Colgate sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia to Unilever for $215 resulting in a pretax gain of $207 ($135 aftertax). In 2011, this gain was more than offset by pretax costs of $224 ($177 aftertax) associated with the implementation of business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, the sale of land in Mexico and a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives include the integration of Sanex, the right-sizing of the Colombia business and the closing of an oral care facility in Mississauga, Canada, and a Hill’s facility in Los Angeles, California.

On June 20, 2011, the Company, Colgate-Palmolive Europe Sàrl, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (together with Unilever N.V., “Unilever”) finalized the Company’s acquisition from Unilever of the Sanex personal care business in accordance with a Business and Share Sale and Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of €676 ($966). The acquisition was financed with available cash, proceeds from the sale of the Company’s Euro-denominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paper.

Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, the Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. Additionally, we continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs. While the Company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the Company’s future results.

The Company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the Company’s strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. This focus, together with the strength of the Company’s global brand names, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 Restructuring Program, should position the Company well to increase shareholder value over the long-term.

17



impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives. Gross profit in 2012 also included the impact of charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and costs related to the sale of land in Mexico. Excluding the items described above, Gross profit increased to $9,963 in 2012 from $9,634 in 2011, primarily due to strong sales growth, cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives and higher pricing, which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases and negative foreign exchange transaction costs.

Worldwide Gross profit margin increased to 58.1% in 2012 from 57.3% in 2011. Excluding the items described above, Gross profit margin increased by 70 basis points (bps) to 58.3% in 2012. The increase was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and higher pricing (120 bps), which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases and negative foreign exchange transaction costs (250 bps).

Worldwide Gross profit increased 4% to $9,590 in 2011 from $9,204 in 2010. Excluding the impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives in 2011, Gross profit increased to $9,634 in 2011.

Worldwide Gross profit margin decreased to 57.3% in 2011 from 59.1% in 2010. Excluding the impact of costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives in 2011, Gross profit margin was 57.6% in 2011. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs driven by global commodity cost increases (390 bps), partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives (190 bps) and higher pricing (50 bps).

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net was $15 in 2012, compared with $52 in 2011 and $59 in 2010. The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2011 to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in interest income on investments held outside of the U.S., partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher debt balances.  The decrease in Interest expense, net from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher debt balances.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate was 32.1% in 2012 and 32.6% in both 2011 and 2010.  As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate as a result of the items described above was 31.8% in 2012 and 2011 and 30.9% in 2010.

Segment Results

The Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world in two distinct product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.  The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of the operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.

Net sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2012 to $3,096, driven by volume growth of 2.0% and net selling price increases of 1.5%. Organic sales in North America increased 3.5% in 2012.

Net sales in North America decreased 0.5% in 2011 to $2,995, as volume growth of 2.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 0.5% were more than offset by net selling price decreases of 3.0%. Organic sales in North America decreased 1.0% in 2011.

Operating profit in North America increased 5% in 2012 to $834, or 26.9% of Net sales. This increase in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by an increase in Gross profit, which was partially offset by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, which were partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher advertising investments.

Operating profit in North America decreased 11% in 2011 to $791, or 26.4% of Net sales. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was driven by a decrease in Gross profit and by an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was a result of lower pricing due to increased promotional investments and higher raw and packaging material costs reflecting global commodity cost increases, which were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales increased due to higher overhead expenses, which were partially offset by lower advertising investments as a percentage of Net sales.

Net sales in Latin America increased 2.5% in 2012 to $4,907, driven by volume growth of 2.5% and net selling price increases of 6.5%, which were largely offset by negative foreign exchange of 6.5%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 10.5% in 2012. Excluding the impact of the divested non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.0% in 2012. Volume gains were led by Brazil, Central America and Mexico and were partially offset by volume declines in Venezuela.

Net sales in Latin America increased 12.0% in 2011 to $4,778, driven by volume growth of 3.0%, net selling price increases of 7.0% and a positive foreign exchange impact of 2.0%. Organic sales in Latin America increased 11.5% in 2011. Excluding the impact of the divested non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia, volume increased 4.5% in 2011.

While Operating profit in Latin America increased 1% in 2012 to $1,430, it decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 29.1%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Other (income) expense, net, which were partially offset by an increase in Gross profit, all as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs, negative foreign exchange transaction costs and costs associated with the increasingly difficult economic and labor environment in Venezuela, which likewise impacted unit volume in that country. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to inflation and foreign exchange.

While Operating profit in Latin America increased 9% in 2011 to $1,414, driven by strong sales growth, it decreased as a percentage of Net sales to 29.6%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in Gross profit, both as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was driven by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs reflecting global commodity cost increases. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher overhead expenses and higher advertising investments supporting volume growth.

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges

2012 Restructuring Program

In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program (the 2012 Restructuring Program) for sustained growth. The program’s initiatives are expected to help Colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.

The 2012 Restructuring Program is expected to produce significant benefits in the Company’s long-term business performance. The major objectives of the program include:
•
Becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the Company’s operations around the world.
•
Simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.
•
Reducing structural costs to continue to increase the Company’s gross and operating profit.
•
Building on Colgate’s current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.


26



Implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, totaling between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), which are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: Employee-Related Costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily Incremental Depreciation and Asset Impairments (15%); and Other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (15%). Anticipated charges for 2013 are expected to amount to approximately $260 to $310 ($185 to $220 aftertax). Over the course of the four-year 2012 Restructuring Program, it is estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures.

It is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in North America (15%), Europe/South Pacific (20%), Latin America (5%), Greater Asia/Africa (10%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (15%) and Corporate (35%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. It is expected that by the end of 2016, the 2012 Restructuring Program will reduce the Company’s global employee workforce by approximately 6% from the 2012 level of approximately 38,000.

Savings are projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. Savings in 2013 should approximate $40 to $50 ($30 to $40 aftertax) effective in the latter half of the year.

Initiatives under the program are focused on the following three areas:
•
Expanding Commercial Hubs - Building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continue to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.
•
Extending Shared Business Services and Streamlining Global Functions - Implementing the Company’s shared service organizational model, already successful in Europe, in all regions of the world. Initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions.
•
Optimizing Global Supply Chain and Facilities - Continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, restructuring and implementation-related charges are reflected in the income statement as follows:

Total 2012 charges relate to restructuring and implementation activity in North America (2%), Europe/South Pacific (55%), Greater Asia/Africa (2%), Hill’s Pet Nutrition (3%) and Corporate (38%).

Costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily concern projects related to the simplification and streamlining of the Company's research and development capabilities and oral care supply chain in Europe as well as the restructuring of certain commercial operations in advance of implementing an overall hubbing strategy.

Employee-related costs primarily included severance and other termination benefits and were calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements.

Other charges consisted primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges included third-party incremental costs of $8 related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives and contract termination costs of $3 directly related to the 2012 Restructuring Program. These charges were expensed as incurred.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP). Management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is provided below.

Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per common share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both on a GAAP basis and excluding the impacts of the charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, the gains on the sales of non-core product lines, costs associated with the business realignment and other cost-saving initiatives, costs related to the sale of land in Mexico, a charge for a competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business, the charge related to the transition to hyperinflationary accounting in Venezuela, termination benefits and the gain related to the reorganization of an overseas subsidiary (non-GAAP). Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations.

The Company uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting process and as a factor in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and stock repurchases). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.

Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operations in 2012 was $3,196 as compared with $2,896 in 2011 and $3,211 in 2010. Net cash provided by operations for 2012 increased due to higher operating earnings, lower voluntary benefit plan contributions as compared to 2011 and a continued focus on working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventory management. This increase was partially offset by higher income tax payments and payment of the previously disclosed competition law matter in France related to a divested detergent business. The decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010 was due primarily to an increase in voluntary benefit plan contributions.

The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). Overall, the Company’s working capital remained flat at 0.7% of Net sales in 2012 as compared with 2011.

Approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program, currently estimated between $1,100 and $1,250 ($775 and $875 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. Savings are currently projected to be in the range of $365 to $435 ($275 to $325 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. The anticipated charges for 2013 are expected to amount to approximately $260 to $310 ($185 to $220 aftertax) and savings in 2013 should approximate $40 to $50 ($30 to $40 aftertax). It is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 Restructuring Program will be funded from operating cash flow. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2012 will be paid before year end 2013.

Investing activities used $865 in 2012, compared with $1,213 and $658 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of the Sanex business in 2011 for $966. In 2012, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Tom's of Maine for $18. During 2011 and 2012, the Company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in Mexico. The final installment of $60 is due upon transfer of the property, which is expected to occur in 2014. The Company sold its non-core laundry detergent business in Colombia in 2011 for $215 ($135 aftertax gain). Purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2012 to $545 from $356 in 2011 primarily due to the Company's investments through its subsidiary in Venezuela in local currency denominated, fixed interest rate bonds issued by the Venezuelan government. Capital expenditures were $565, $537 and $550 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. Capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to increase to an annual rate of approximately 4.5% of Net sales, primarily driven by the 2012 Restructuring Program.

Financing activities used $2,301 of cash during 2012 compared to $1,242 and $2,624 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt, an increase in dividends paid in 2012, and higher share repurchase costs due to an appreciation in stock value, partially offset by higher proceeds from exercises of stock options. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the issuance of debt and a lower level of share repurchases as compared to 2010.

Long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $5,176 as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $4,776 as of December 31, 2011, and total debt increased to $5,230 as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $4,810 as of December 31, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.95% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the second quarter of 2012, the Company issued $500 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.3% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in 2012 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings, which were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company issued $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.6%, $400 of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.3% and $300 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.45% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2011 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and to repay outstanding indebtedness under a €408 credit facility. During the second quarter of 2011, the Company issued $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated three-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.25% and $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated six-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.625% under the Company’s shelf registration statement. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company issued $250 of U.S. dollar-denominated ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.95% and $188 of U.S. dollar-denominated five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.375% under the Company's shelf registration statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances in the second quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010 were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings.

At December 31, 2012, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,547 (including under the two facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. In November 2011, the Company entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. In 2012, this facility was extended for an additional year and will expire in November 2017. The Company also has the ability to draw $145 from a revolving credit facility that expires in November 2013. Commitment fees related to credit facilities are not material.

Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $443 and $671 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2012 and 2011 were $1,562 and $1,497, respectively. The maximum daily balance outstanding for commercial paper during 2012 and 2011 was $2,042 and $1,897, respectively. The Company regularly classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt as it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in 2017.

Certain of the facilities with respect to the Company’s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company’s long-term debt and credit facilities.

Dividend payments in 2012 were $1,277, an increase from $1,203 in 2011 and $1,142 in 2010. Common stock dividend payments increased to $2.44 per share in 2012 from $2.27 per share in 2011 and $2.03 per share in 2010. On March 8, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.62 per share from $0.58 per share, effective as of the second quarter 2012. The Series B Preference stock dividend payments were $16.24 per share in 2010. The Series B Preference Stock was converted to common stock on December 29, 2010.

The Company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. The share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in September 2011 (the 2011 Program) authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The Board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the Company’s compensation and benefit programs.

Aggregate share repurchases in 2012 consisted of 18.8 million common shares under the 2011 Program and 0.6 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,943. Aggregate repurchases in 2011 consisted of 20.4 million common shares under both the 2011 Program and a previously authorized repurchase program, and 0.9 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,806. Aggregate repurchases in 2010 consisted of 24.4 million common shares under previously authorized repurchase programs, and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $2,020.

Cash and cash equivalents increased $6 during 2012 to $884 at December 31, 2012, compared to $878 at December 31, 2011, of which $861 and $824 were held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts include $170 and $385 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are subject to currency exchange controls in Venezuela, limiting the total amount of Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately $4,300 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the Company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. Should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable.

_______
(1)
Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management’s best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(2)
The Company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2012 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.

Long-term liabilities associated with the Company’s postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. The amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates” below) and voluntary Company contributions.  Based on current information, the Company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified U.S. pension plan in 2013. Management’s best estimate of voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans for the year ending December 31, 2013 is approximately $100. In addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending December 31, 2013 from the Company's assets is estimated to be approximately $94.

Additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities.  See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

As more fully described in Part I, Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.

Managing Foreign Currency, Interest Rate, Commodity Price and Credit Risk Exposure

The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the Company’s treasury and risk management policies. The Company’s treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.

The sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. See Notes 2 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.


32



Foreign Exchange Risk

As the Company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. See the “Results of Operations” section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on Net sales in each segment.

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other than those operating in highly inflationary environments, are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments (currently, Venezuela), inventories, prepaid expenses, goodwill and property, plant and equipment are remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these operations are included in Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company.

The Company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward, option and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.

The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. At the end of 2012, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $40.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt in all cases, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.

Based on year-end 2012 variable rate debt levels, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased Interest expense, net by $12 in 2012.

Commodity Price Risk

The Company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, tropical oils, essential oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. The Company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. Futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the Pet Nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.

The Company’s open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized gains of $1 and net unrealized losses of $1 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At the end of 2012, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.


33



Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the Company’s policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." ASU No. 2013-02 requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements, for those amounts required to be reclassified into Net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period, cross-reference to other disclosures is required. As permitted under ASU 2013-02, the Company has elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of 2013.

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. As permitted under ASU No. 2011-05, the Company has elected to present items of Net income and Other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. The Company’s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.

▪
Shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Company’s Gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. If such costs had been included in Cost of sales, Gross profit margin would have decreased by 740 bps, from 58.1% to 50.7% in 2012 and decreased by 750 bps and 730 bps in 2011 and 2010, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.

▪
The Company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (80% of inventories) and the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (20% of inventories). There would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2012, 2011 and 2010 had all inventories been accounted for under the FIFO method.

The areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits, stock options, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingencies.

▪
In pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for U.S. defined benefit plans was 4.14%, 4.90% and 5.30% as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other U.S. postretirement plans was 4.32%, 5.26% and 5.30% as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discount rates used for the U.S. defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the

34



estimated payouts of the U.S. plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment-grade corporate bonds rated AA. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for U.S. plans was 7.30% as of December 31, 2012, 7.75% as of December 31, 2011 and 8.00% as of December 31, 2010. In determining the long-term rate of return, the Company considers the nature of the plans’ investments, the expectation for the plans’ investment strategies and the historical rate of return.

Average annual rates of return for the U.S. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were 13%, 4%, 8%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In addition, the current rate of return assumption for the U.S. plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40% in fixed income securities, 52% in equity securities and 8% in real estate and alternative investments. A 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $2. A 1% change in the discount rate for the U.S. pension plans would impact future Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by approximately $7. A third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. This rate was 3.50% as of December 31, 2012 and 4.00% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans.

▪
The assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. The assumed rate of increase is 7.5% for 2013, declining to 5.0% by 2018 and remaining at 5.0% for the years thereafter. The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company by $6.

▪
The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black-Scholes) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-option awards. The weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $13.46. The Black-Scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options. These assumptions include the expected term of options, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. While these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value.  A one-year change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. A one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%.

▪
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the Company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. The Company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. The asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. Qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the recent Sanex acquisition, which were recorded at fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value. Therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. Asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 Restructuring Program requires management’s best estimate of net realizable values.

▪
The recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.

▪
Tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. Factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.


35



▪
Legal and other contingency reserves are based on management’s assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. While it is possible that the Company’s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s contingencies.

The Company generates revenue through the sale of well-known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms. While the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates, there is a short time frame (typically less than 60 days) between the shipment of product and cash receipt, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of the Company’s significant accounting policies.

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements
